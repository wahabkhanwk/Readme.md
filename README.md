**Reverse Engineer | Embedded Systems Developer | Security Researcher**

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I work at the intersection of low-level systems, application security, and reverse engineering. My focus is on analyzing and securing software across Android, firmware, and embedded platforms. I enjoy solving complex challenges, building custom tooling, and contributing to cybersecurity through research and development.

## 🔧 What I Do

- **Reverse Engineering**
  - APK decompilation and analysis using tools like JADX, APKTool, Ghidra, and Frida
  - Native code reversing and obfuscation analysis

- **Embedded Systems & Firmware**
  - Firmware reverse engineering, secure boot, and cryptographic validation
  - Development in C, C++, Rust, and ARM Assembly for bare-metal and RTOS-based systems

- **Security Research**
  - Malware analysis and memory forensics (Volatility, TShark)
  - Network intrusion detection and rule tuning (Suricata)

- **CTF & Offensive Tooling**
  - Creator and solver of binary exploitation challenges
  - Custom CTF environments with Docker and CTFd
